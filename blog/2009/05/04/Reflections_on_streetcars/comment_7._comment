You may be interested to know that the Debian source packages actually contain support for this. Read debian/README.cross in both the binutils and gcc source packages for details.

Basically, it boils down to using dpkg-cross to turn a libc package into a libc-cross package, create a file in debian/ with the architecture you want to build for, regenerate debian/control, and build the package as normal. Pretty simple, really; I've done this a lot of times
