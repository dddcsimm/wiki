Yes -- I believe I had come across  mention of Emdebian while
researching this time. But the problem I was trying to solve was more
general -- and not just arm/armel/embedded architectures.  The use
case solved by my little script is about how to create cross
compilation from any native architecture to _any_ other architecture
-- so I can build a *SPARC* cross compiler on my machine, with this
script. 

There is also the issue that if I use the Emdebian stuff, I would
never learn what is going on under the hood. Now I know.
