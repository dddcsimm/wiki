\"But the problem I was trying to solve was more general â€” and not just arm/armel/embedded architectures\"

I only gave those two as examples. Emdebian has pre-built binary toolchains for most Debian architectures (including m68k, ia64, mips, mipsel, sparc, hppa, powerpc and alpha) and going back as far as gcc-3.3
http://www.emdebian.org/debian/pool/main/g/

\"There is also the issue that if I use the Emdebian stuff, I would never learn what is going on under the hood. Now I know.\"

True, but you've also got the assurance that the Emdebian toolchains are in widespread usage, reproducible and quite well tested.
