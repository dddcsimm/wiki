But it is a pain in the butt for users when there are SSL protected mailing list archives with a self-signed certificate. I don't care about encryption, but I have to deal with a seriously convoluted process for making an exception.

Please, if it's not worth a $400/yr certificate, it's probably not worth protecting with SSL in the first place.
