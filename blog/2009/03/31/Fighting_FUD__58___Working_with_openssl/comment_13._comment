\"I do not think that logically follows.\"

Sorry. That's becuase your blog ate the first paragraph of my post.

I very frequently run into people who set up ssl-protected (but otherwise public) mailing list archives. I want to read the archives, but since the certificate is self-signed, FireFox throws up a massive warning and requires 5 clicks to make a security exception. Obviously the appropriate use here is to not use SSL, since there's nothing to protect.

If your page is intended for anyone other than a small (known) audience (like private development pages or strictly personal use). Then you ought to shell out for a certificate that doesn't cause undue inconvenience to your users.

It's in this context that I say if it's not worth shelling out $400 for a certificate, then it probably isn't worth encrypting.
