I guess we shall have to differ on this issue. There are a whole lot of things I think I want to remain private, but for which I shall not shell out $400. Perhaps I come fro an older generation that thinks far many more things are private than the younger set seems to now, and I can see when few things are deemed private, then it might be worth shelling out hundreds of dollars for.

I also think that the inconvenience for end users is perhaps not as important an issue for me as it can be for others; I am not making money for the things I am securing, so if the benefit for the user does not compensate for 5 mouse clicks, then perhaps they do not need to use the service in question. (It does stand your assumption on obligations on its head). If people donate me a multi-year cert, then they would have more of a say in it.

The bottom line is: what is more important? My money, or an one time exercise of a few mouse clicks for the consumer of the protected service? As the person providing the service, I think I get to make that decision, and the trade off.
