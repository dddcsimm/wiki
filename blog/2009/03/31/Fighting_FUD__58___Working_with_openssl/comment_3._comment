I do not  think that logically follows. I have important things in my
life, but that does not imply that they are only important if I throw
several hundred dollars at random folks. What is critical is that
there is a cryptographically secure channel for communication; and
that channel is equally secure of my mail server talks to my mail
client using a certificate I signed myself. Can you demonstrate that
paying some random person a few hundred dollars will improve the
security of the communication between my MUA and my mail server?

As to it being painful to the end user, Yes, in some browsers there is
a scary warning about the certifying authority signature being
unknown, and people have to add an exception about it. So, is an user
having to add a security exception to their browsers worth $400/year
for me? I think so. I have web servers that provide Genealogy
information for my family, MTA's and IMAP servers for friends, and the
accepting the CA sig is a one time deal for services rendered. I think
it is cheap at the price.
