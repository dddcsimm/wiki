Well, yes. A single trusted certifying authority is a different beast
from a web of trust angle. But from a regulation angle, regulaters and
watchdogs can better monitor the single basket with all your eggs than
going on an easter hunt.

While usig OpenPGP with tls is a nice concept, and might work when you
have a trusted path to the key signing the cert, the current state of
affairs does not lend itself to wide adoption. Here are the services
running on the host servicing this blog:

- Apache HTTPS
- Sendmail 
- Courier IMAP and POP
- Munin Client
- LDAP (well, it used to run LDAP)

All of them have an easy integration with PKI via openssl. How hard
would it be for me to switch to key based TLS?
