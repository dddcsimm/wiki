And old favorite from James Clavell. I have lost track of how often I
have read this book -- often enough, certainly, that certain chapters
are ingrained in my head. I saw a movie with the same name recently --
and it was not really all that close to the book; but I can not really
blame the director. If you have not yet read Tai-Pan, you should.
