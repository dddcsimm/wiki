Given how much I am enjoying the vampire Earth series from
E. E. Knight, I thought I would check out the Age of Fire series from
the same author.  This is deliciously different -- rarely have I read
a book about dragons from the perspective of the dragon! This books
opens the dilemma of the temptation of the tasty, pesky humanoids, and
yet how dangerous it is to eat them with abandon.

Unlike the humans in vampire earth, the dragon protagonist has no
trouble forming and developing relationships, and it is a very
satisfying journey, after all.
