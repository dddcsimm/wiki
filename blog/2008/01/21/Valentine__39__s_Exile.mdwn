As anticipated, the shakeup that drives Valentine away from a stable
mid-level military career occurs, he is accused, court-martialed, and
drummed out of the service, and goes on on a road trip, though
thankfully this is no travelogue, like the thunderbolt book was. Some
new things were learned, and maybe there will be some character
development after all.
