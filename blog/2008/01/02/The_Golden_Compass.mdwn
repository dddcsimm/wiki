Since there has been so much uproar caused by the movie, I decided I
would have a look at the trilogy -- though I generally have not been
much into Philip Pullman, since I have found his books usually too
simplistic and childlike -- which makes sense, I suppose, since they
are not really targeted to adults.

It is a pity that I never ran across these when I was still a child,
since they are much better written than the Narnia chronicles.  I
quite think that Lyra is a well drawn character, though she behaves in
ways unfathomable to me, but perhaps this is because she is a girl and
perhaps it is because I have never seen my daemon.
