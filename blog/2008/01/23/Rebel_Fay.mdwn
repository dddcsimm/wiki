The Rebel Fay is the latest installment of the Noble Dead series by
Barb & J. C. Hendee, and stands head and shoulder above the Vampire
earth stuff I have been recently reading when it comes to character
development, plot intricacy, and believable back story.

Written from the view point of a spirit creature, the Fay, currently
constrained into the body of a dog, this brings our friends into the
lands of the Elves, and we learn a bit more about the rationale for
why the Dhampir was created.  Can't wait for the next book to come
out.
