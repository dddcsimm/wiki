Both Judy and I managed to make it to DC for the annual company
Christmas dinner, held this year at the tail end of January, since we
could not otherwise arrange for a common meeting time.  We spent
Friday driving around Sterling, VA, looking at houses for sale -- and
deciding that the lots they sat on were too cramped for our tastes,
having lived out in the country for so long as we have. Had authentic
Dim Sum for lunch.

The party was a success, since someone had brought along a inflatable
play jungle for the kids, and food was interesting and the
conversation fantastic. Judy left on Sunday; I had to recycle the
rental car and the hotel room, since after I had set u0p the trip it
turned out that I had to stay back longer in DC for business.  I ended
up returning on the 31st; and every single one of these three plane
flights was delayed or cancelled.
