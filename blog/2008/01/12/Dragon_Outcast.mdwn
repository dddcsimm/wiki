The last of the dragon books from E. E. Knight. And about the least of
the litter: the crippled, outcast bronze -- too insignificant to have
been named.  And yet, the one to go furthest of the litter. I wish the
lives of the litter mates intersected a bit when they were grown --
but they might as well have been on different planets.  But I suppose
that leaves room for future tales.
