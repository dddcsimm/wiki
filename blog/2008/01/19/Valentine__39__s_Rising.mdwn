Ah, thank goodness. The quality of the story begins to improve; though
never rising to the level of the first two books.  Valentine leads his
rag tag crew to rise up against the bad guys that have overrun the
safe haven.  However, Valentine is still getting too entrenched in the
system; and that rarely works well for the kind of tales that jell for
this character.
