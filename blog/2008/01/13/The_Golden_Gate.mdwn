Yet another of Alistair Maclean screenplays pretending to be a
book. Set mostly on the Golden Gate bridge, it would have made a
spectacular movie.  Clever plot hooks, but a almost non-existent plot
line; but still, better than some action movies from that era.  Chalk
another one up to guilty pleasures.
