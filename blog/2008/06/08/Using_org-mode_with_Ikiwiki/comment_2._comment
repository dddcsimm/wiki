Also one could write the plugin (instead of org.pm) completely in Emacs Lisp (using http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/XmlRpc ) as an [\"external plugin\"](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/write/external/), which would be more fun (and also provide a remarkable example of an external plugin for Ikiwiki written in Emacs Lisp).
