Hi!

Perhaps listing it at http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/ would help people find it.

Also, have you seen [muse.pm](http://repo.or.cz/w/muse-el.git/blob/773dc6a51a9cdc55b51d4f0b0dcb9c654f9d059b:/contrib/ikiwiki/IkiWiki/Plugin/muse.pm) from [emacs-muse--Ikiwiki integartion](http://mwolson.org/static/doc/muse/Ikiwiki.html)? Technically, it must be similar (it also calls emacs), so perhaps there are some valuable ideas in that code.
