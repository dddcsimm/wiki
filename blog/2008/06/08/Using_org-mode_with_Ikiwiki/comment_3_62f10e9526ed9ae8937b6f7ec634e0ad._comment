Thanks for the useful plugin.

I had to comment out the line '$ret=~s/(<\/div>\s*$)//s;' near the end of the file, otherwise one of the <div> tags doesn't get closed properly. 

My code blocks didn't get htmlized by default either so I also changed the beginning of the eval line to read \"--eval '(progn (autoload (quote htmlize-buffer) \\"/path/to/site-lisp/htmlize.el\\" nil t)(... 

If you have emacs22 or non-standard locations for lisp files it is also worth  changing the '--batch -l' part to use ~/.mycustomfile rather than 'org'. In this file I added:

(add-to-list 'load-path \"~/path/to/site-lisp\")
(add-to-list 'load-path \"~/path/to/newer/org-mode\")
(require 'htmlize) ;; colour for code segments
(require 'org)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\.org$\" . org-mode)) ;; not sure if this is needed

(setq org-export-htmlize-output-type (quote css))

;;; and some of my blogging preferences
(setq org-export-headline-levels 3 
      org-export-with-toc nil 
      org-export-author-info nil 
      org-export-with-section-numbers nil  
      org-export-skip-text-before-1st-heading nil 
      org-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists t 
      org-export-with-sub-superscripts nil)
