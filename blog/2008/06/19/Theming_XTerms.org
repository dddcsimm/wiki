I decoded to turn my efforts to
providing more copacetic colors in other aspects of my working
environment. I'll write more about my effort to write my own color
theme for
#+BEGIN_HTML
[[!debpkg fvwm]]
#+END_HTML
when it is closer to being done. For now, I'll
concentrate on "ANSI Colors" in XTerms, and how one may theme those.
The old Tektronics (or ANSI) terminals had 8 colors, namely, 
/black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan/,
and /white/. These colors had a normal, and a *bright* mode. The
default set of colors is OK, but is not optimal, since they have to
work on both dark and light backgrounds; however, I use mostly dark
background colors.

#+BEGIN_HTML
[[!img images/xterm.png class="floatr" size=96x50 alt="ls colors"]] 
#+END_HTML
Given that, I set to design my own colors, using fully laturated
colors, with a base luminosity of 70, and equally spaced in chroma --
and used the same saturation and chroma, but a luminosity of 80, for
the bright set. This results in a pleasant pastely set of colors,
which are e4asy on the eyes, when used on very dark backgrounds. 
The configuration can be seen in
#+BEGIN_HTML
[[XTerm|miscellaneous/xterm_color.html]].
#+END_HTML
I set the colors for /rxvt/ as well as /xterm/. Now, the most
noticeable effect of these changes is if using the color option for
/ls/, therefore the next thing to do was to configure the colors used
by /ls/ using a utility dedicated for that task, namely,
/dircolors/. By trial and error, I modified the default configurati0on
provided by /dircolors/ and ended up with
#+BEGIN_HTML
[[dir_colors|miscellaneous/dir_colors.html]],
#+END_HTML
with the results as you see.
