I finally got time from my day job to set up the infrastructure for a
vote. This entailed setting up a temporary vote key (the key I had set
up earlier for the draft ballot had expired), adding the latest
proposal (F). And set up the cron jobs, and so on.

Any way, head out over to the 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2004/vote_004">vote page</a>
for the juicy details. Take care in reading over the details, for
this is not just a GR, it is a GR that changes foundation documents,
and as the last vote has shown, any foundation doc change merits a
modicum of diligence.
