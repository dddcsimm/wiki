This has been a long time coming; I've wanted to set up something
like this ever since I saw Alan Cox's <a href="http://www.linux.org.uk/diary/">diary</a>.
Now that Judy has expressed an interest in keeping a
<a href="/">family blog</a>, there was no excuse for further
procrastination (not that that often stops one).  Of course, exactly
because there was no excuse for procrastination, I proceeded to
procrastinate; I had to find a mechanism of determining pleasing color
schemes which was better than trial and a lot of errors.
