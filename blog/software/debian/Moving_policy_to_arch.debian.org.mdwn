I have long been interested in moving the debian-policy package away
from CVS, but had never quite managed to gather enough motivation to
do the switch. Debian policy has long had an Alioth project, but I
finally managed to file a support ticket, and nag Wichert into
creating the arch project for policy.

The first step was to convert the CVS version into an arch repository,
and this is where [[debpkg cscvs]] comes in. cscvs is
nice, but I am told that Canonical has a better, private version, and
helpful folks there offered to do a managed conversion to arch for me
using these cutting edge tools. I declined, being persnickety enough
to want to convert Debian technical policy using tools in Debian
itself. And, apart from two change-sets (numbers 117 and 125), cscvs
managed to do the conversion to arch (the
[[debpkg bazaar]] flavour) nicely on its own (well,
after a few false starts as I climbed the learning curve). Came to 283
change-sets. Have a look at [my Debian policy branch][local].
It can be registered at 
<code>http://arch.debian.org/arch/private/srivasta/archive-etch/</code>.

The next step was to create a baz archive on <tt>arch.debian.org</tt>,
and use Clint's ACL recipe to allow people in the <tt>dbnpolicy</tt>
group to have write access. And then, since I wanted this branch to
also have the full set of distinct patch logs, I cycled through all
286 patches in my local branch, replayed and committed them into the
remote branch one by one. You may [browse][remote] the public, or
release, branch as well. This version can be registered at
<code>http://arch.debian.org/arch/dbnpolicy/etch/</code>.
