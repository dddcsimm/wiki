*Sheep Farmers Daughter* is an old favourite, which I have read lord
only knows how many times. Elizabeth Moon has written a gritty,
enthralling story of the making of a Paladin. This is the first book
of a trilogy, and introduces us to a new universe through the eyes of
a young innocent (which is a great device to introduce us to a
universe from the viewpoint of someone who is not seeing it through
eyes jaundiced by experience).

For me, books have always been an escape from the humdrum mundanity of
everyday existence. Putting myself in the shoes of a character in the
story is the whole point; and this story excels there: it is very
believable.  Not many people can tell a tale that comes alive, and Ms
Moon is one of them. An ex-marine, much of the detail of the military
life of Paks has been drawn from Moon's own military experience.  More
than just that, the world is richly drawn, and **interesting.**

I read this book in a hotel room in Chicago, since, as usual, there
was nothing really interesting on TV, and I don't "get" the whole bar
scene.
