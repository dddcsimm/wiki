A nicely placed movie about a bleak future, and how people cope with
despair and desperate times. While it did not quite come together in
the details (anything outside of England was a big unknown blur), and
the London of 2027 seemed not much different from any current day city
under semi martial law (technology, for instance, seems to have frozen
at todays levels), it was still fast paced, and enjoyable, and anyway,
this is not primarily a sci-fi flick.

Recommended.
