Based on the [[The_Secret_Servant]], I ordered a whole slew of books
from the same author, including this one. I am still impressed by the
geopolitical insight; a few years before 9/11, the author sets up a
reasonable facsimile by having evil doers blow up a plane taking off
from New York; though the evil doers in question are bunches of cold
war nostalgic members of the military-intelligence-industrial
collective.

The action is till fast paced, though I am far less impressed by the
characters than I was in the secret servant. Micheal and Elizabeth
seem to be two dimensional cut outs, not people; the person I felt
most in touch with was the evil doer assassin.
