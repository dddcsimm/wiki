*Divided Allegiance* is the middle of the trilogy, the one that I hate
reading. Not because Ms Moon's book is bad, which it is not, it is
still as gripping as the others, and comes closer to the high fantasy
of Tolkien -- it is just that I hate what happens to Paks in the book,
and the fact that the books ends, leaving her in that state. I guess I
am a wimp when it comes to some things that happen to characters I am
identifying with. However, it has been so long since I read the series
that I have begun to forget the details, so I went through and read it
anyway.

This is a transition book: the [[blog/2007/11/08/Deeds_of_Paksenarrion]]
was about Paksenarrion the line warrior, and the final book is where
she becomes the stuff of legends. I usually read the first and last
here.
