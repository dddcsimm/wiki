I bought this book by Daniel Silva last week at SFO, faced with a long
wait for the red eye back home, since I recalled hearing about it on
NPR, and reading a review in *Time* magazine, or was it the *New
Yorker*? Anyway, the review said he is his generation's finest writer
of international intrigue, one of America's most gifted spy novelists
ever.  I guess Graham Greene and John le Carre belong to an older
generation. Anyway, everything I read or heard about it was very
positive. 

Daniel Silva is far less cynical than Le Carre, and his world does
not gel quite as well, to my ears, as Smiley's circus did. The hero,
Gabriel Allon, does have some super human traits, but, thank the lord,
is not James bond. I was impressed by Silva's geo-politics, though -
paragraphs from the book seem to appear almost verbatim in current
event reports in the International Herald Tribune and BBC stories. 

I like this books (to the extent of ordering another 7 from this
author from Amazon today), and appreciate the influx of new blood in
the international espionage market.  Lately, the genre has been
treated by lack luster, mediocre knock offs of the  *Bourne
Identity* -- and the engaging pace of the original has never been
successfully replicated in the sequels. And Silva's writing is better
than Ludlum's.
