*Oath of Gold* rounds up this excellent fantasy series from Elizabeth
Moon.  It is a pity that she never came back to this character (though
she wrote a couple of prequels), despite the fact that the ending
paragraph leaves ample room for sequels "... when the call of Gird
came, Paksenarrion left for other lands."

This is high fantasy in true Tolkien manner, but faster paced, more
gritty, and with characters one could relate to.  I am already looking
forward to my next re-read of the series.
