I had somehow managed to miss out on [The White
Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Company) while I was
growing up and devouring all of Sherlock Holmes stories and *The Lost
World*. This is a pity, since I would have like this bit of the
hundred years war much better when I was young and uncritical. 

Oh, I *do* like the book.  The pacing is fast, if somewhat
predictable.  The book is well researched, and leads you from one
historic event to the other, and is peppered with all kinds of
historical figures, and I believe it to be quite authentic in it's
period settings. Unfortunately, there is very little character
development, and though the characters are deftly sketched, they all
lack depth, which would not have bothered the young me.  Also, Sir
John Hawkwood, of the white company, is mentioned only briefly in
passing.

This compares less favourably than Walter Scott's [Quentin
Durward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Durward), set in a
period less than 80 years in the future.  but then, I've always have
had a weakness for Scott.  As for Conan Doyle, the lost world was far
more gripping.

I am now looking for books about
[Hawkwood](http://www.amazon.com/John-Hawkwood-English-Mercenary-Fourteenth-Century/dp/0801883237),
a mercenary captain mentioned in this book, as well as Dickson's
*Childe Cycle* books. The only books I have found so far on the golden
age of the Condottieri are so darned expensive.
