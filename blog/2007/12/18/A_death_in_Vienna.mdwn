The final part of the Nazi escapees and the collaborators that helped
them.  This book takes aim at the Swiss banking system, flush with
Jewish gold, and the ways in which war criminals were helped and
ensconced into high finance society post-WW-II. Again, I think this
trilogy leads back to the original book I read by Silva (the most
recent, it turns out).

Silva's writing definitely seems to be maturing as he goes along, and
the characters get to be more human with every book.  This is a writer
still coming into his own; and while the trade craft might not yet be
up to Smiley's standards, it is not very far off.
