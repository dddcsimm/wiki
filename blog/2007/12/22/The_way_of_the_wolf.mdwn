This is a SCi-Fi series from E. E. Knight. It is not often that one
comes across a brand new series in fantasy or science fiction; and
more rarely still when it has the quality of this one (The Vampire
Earth series).  This is a post-apocolaptic novel, the apocalypse being a
virus that killed most of the human population, unleashed by a
gate-travelling extra-solar species to disrupt human resistance as they
took over.  Ostensibly about vampires, it provides an interesting back
story to explain "master" vampires and their reaper thralls.

What was captivating about this book is the detailed and generally
coherent world building, the swaths of land under outsider control,
where there is law and order and culling of humans for food; and the
rag tag resistance.  The characters are fairly well developed (though
the author shies away from romantic relationships of any kind).

Not since the Recluse novels have I felt this way about a new series.
