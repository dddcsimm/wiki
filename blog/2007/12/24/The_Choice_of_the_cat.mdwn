The second in the Vampire Earth series by E. E. Knight, this book has
our protagonist moving to the next step in the genetically augmented
"hunter" clans of the human resistance. Well written, though the next
stage of the character development would require the people to
actually get into some relationships. Apart from that, the series is
moving well along, with other team members being brought into the
fold.
