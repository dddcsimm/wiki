This is an old favorite from Alistair Maclean, and I'm revisiting this
after some 20 odd years since the last time I read it. This books is
from a time period towards the end of his good phase, and is heavier
on the action and lower on plot, and the amount of suspension of
disbelief is correspondingly higher than his best, but this is still
very good.  Perhaps I don't like it just because it is so sad.
Anyway, this is one of a set of Maclean novels I picked up recently,
and some of the others are more of a guilty pleasure than this one.
