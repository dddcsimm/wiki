This was a good movie. Perhaps I'm guilty of heresy in saying this,
but it was not a great movie. It did come as somewhat of a surprise to
me that the movie was about the flag raising (a humdrum chore when it
was done) _photograph_, not about Iwo Jima or ghe marine corps or
uch about the war (apart from what lead to the flag raising -- mostly
to provide a contrast to the the actual flag raising.  The impression
I took away from it, the thing that made the most impact on me, was
the sheer desperation of the fund raising, trying to get a weary and
cynical population to buy war bonds.

Clint Eastwood is to be commended on an unusual take on the sordid
details of war -- there are no drum beats going in this movie.
