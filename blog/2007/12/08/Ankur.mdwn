This one of the very first "art" films from Indian cinema, and in some
senses the very antithesis of a Bollywood movie. It explores things
like caste, parent child relationships, and aspects of rural society
in India, and much, much, more. And while doing so, it manages to
tell a tail that draws you into it, and into caring for the
characters. Pretty amazing.
