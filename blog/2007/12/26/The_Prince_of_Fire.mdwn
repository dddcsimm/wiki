This novel brings Allon's past, and present, deeper into the lime
light; and Silva's writing is beginning to take on the human touch
that his earliest works lacked.  He invites the reader to invest in
the character far more now than he used, and I think that makes his
work better.  I like how he is also beginning to bring Leah back alive
again, a little at a time.  And how this plays with Chiara.
