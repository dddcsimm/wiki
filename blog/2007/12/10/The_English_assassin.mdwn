This is the first of a trilogy that Silva has written around the Nazi
looting of the wealth of the Jews of Europe, specifically the art, in
this book.  This was an excellent read; I think Silva might have found
his groove talking about the broader historical context of the Israeli
intelligence service operations and the hunting of those responsible
for the holocaust.

I certainly recommend this book.
