The first Gabriel Allon novel by Daniel Silva.  It feels much better
than the Michael Osborne series; I can begin to feel that Gabriel is
human.  Tariq feels a little too super human; but the book is fast
paced, and better than the run of the mill fare, though only
marginally so.  The bad guy is still one of the jihadists like those
that we met in [[The_Secret_Servant]].
