A while ago, my [[!debpkg guessnet]] setup started
messing up, just before a business trip, and I did not have the time
to debug the error. After a quick consult on IRC, I installed and
configured [[!debpkg laptop-net]], which worked. 

While I had a working package that would let me carry my laptop from
home to LUG to office, and various trips with Hotel networks once in a
while, I always had to tell the system which scheme to use, since
several of the networks used similar IP addresses and topologies
(welcome to the world of NAT). I have never been comfortable with the
fact that [[!debpkg laptop-net]] did not consider MAC
addresses while making its determinations.

[[!debpkg laptop-net]], on the other hand, is like a combination of
[[!debpkg ifplugd]], [[!debpkg intuitively]], and [[!debpkg switchconf]],
except better since it is all integrated and works
seamlessly. [[!debpkg guessnet]] does seem to work better for me,
though, if for nothing else since it can actually determine where the
laptop finds itself. I have successfully integrated [[!debpkg
guessnet]] in with [[!debpkg ifplugd]], and made sure that things play
nice even with [[!debpkg hotplug]] in the picture. So I am a happy
Guessnet camper once again.
