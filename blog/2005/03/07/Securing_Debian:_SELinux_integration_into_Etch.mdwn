Well, yes, that sounds somewhat pompous. But I do think this is a
worthwhile release goal; from where I stand I think that hard-hat
security is a critical option for any OS to remain viable in the
current security conscious environment, and Debian, after a period of
being well ahead of the curve (thanks to Russell Coker, Colin Walters,
Brian May, and others), has fallen well behind entities like Red Hat
and Gentoo when it comes to providing a hardened, secure platform.

So, along with a few other people (Greg T. Norris, Lorenzo
Garcia-Heirro), I have started a 
<a href="http://www.golden-gryphon.com/software/security/selinux.xhtml">mini
 project</a> 
to bring Debian's SELinux patched packages back in sync with the
latest upstream and the latest SELinux patches, and to make it easier
for Debian developers to access SELinux patches. The only package that
is ready to go is <code>coreutils</code>, and that is thanks to Greg.

I've just come back from the <a href="http://selinux-symposium.org/">Se-Linux symposium</a>,
followed by the <a href="http://cplug.net/conference/">Central
Pennsylvania LUG Security conference</a>, which was a lot of fun. I
also managed to get myself talked into upgrading to the
<a href="http://www.x.org">X Org</a> server, which is to be
3expected after spending two days sitting Next to Jim Gettys at a
conference watching the neat gizmos.

And, if I get through this key signing process, I may get my key
connectivity ranking up again (also thanks to getting it signed by
Russell Coker). Of course, due to my weird key signing 
<a href="/software/security/keysign.xhtml">protocol</a> this is more
tedious than the norm, but hey, that's what you get for trying to add
value to your signature.
