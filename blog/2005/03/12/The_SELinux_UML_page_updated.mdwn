I finally got around to updating the SELinux UML
<a href="/software/security/Se-Linux-uml.xhtml">recipe</a>
page to the latest 2.6.11.2 kernel. Of course, the new
<code>linux</code> UML kernel expects a newer version of SELinux
policy (19) than I had in my <tt>root_fs</tt>, so I'll have to rebuild
a new root file system. I wanted to get the newest version of the
SELinux tools into Sid, but I seem to be coming down with a flu like
thing.  Since I would like to see Etch be SELinux capable, it is
important that the barrier of entry be low for people wanting to play
around with it.
