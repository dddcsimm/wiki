Well, all but one, since we still do not have one of the contributions
in. I also think we have an agreement about the timing of the IRC
debate, so we are well on our way to having a properly educated and
primed electorate. As always, look at the
<a href="http://vote.debian.org/2005/vote_001">vote page</a> for
details. 

While working on my key-signing-helper script, I came across examples
of <code>IO::Select</code> usage that I think shall benefit
<tt>devotee</tt>, though I am leery of changing things this close to a
vote. Oh, well, I guess the new gpg output processing code shall see
the light of day with the first GR of the season.
