Well, as most of us have gathered, yet another DPL election
session came to a close. The highlights from a technical standpoint
this year were that 
<a href="/cgi-bin/archzoom.cgi/srivasta@debian.org--2003-primary/devotee/?expand">Devotee</a>
was modified mid-stream to grok encrypted ballots (early encrypted
ballots, though rejected, contributed by testing devotee). The other,
more visible, high light was that devotee now spits out dot graphs to
depict the pairwise contests in the Beat matrix, and the resulting
graphical representation of the results were published. The reaction
being mostly positive, I went back and punched in graphs on most of
previous results that were at all complex and could benefit from the
graph diagrams.

While I was changing the vote pages, I responded to criticism of the
navigation panel (or the lack thereof) on the vote pages, and the
result(after a couple of false starts) is aesthetically more
pleasing (well, to me it is).

Hmm. Bits from the secretary ain't ever gonna happen. As this entry
shows, they are deadly dull.
