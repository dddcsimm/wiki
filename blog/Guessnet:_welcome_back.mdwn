A while ago, my [[shortcut debpkg="guessnet"]] setup started
messing up, just before a business trip, and I did not have the time
to debug the error. After a quick consult on IRC, I installed and
configured [[shortcut debpkg="laptop-net"]], which worked. 

While I had a working package that would let me carry my laptop from
home to LUG to office, and various trips with Hotel networks once in a
while, I always had to tell the system which scheme to use, since
several of the networks used similar IP addresses and topologies
(welcome to the world of NAT). I have never been comfortable with the
fact that [[shortcut debpkg="laptop-net"]] did not consider MAC
addresses while making its determinations.

[[shortcut debpkg="laptop-net"]], on the other hand, is like a
combination of [[shortcut debpkg="ifplugd"]],
[[shortcut debpkg="intuitively"]], and
[[shortcut debpkg="switchconf"]], except better since it is all
integrated and works seamlessly. [[shortcut debpkg="guessnet"]]
does seem to work better for me, though, if for nothing else since it
can actually determine where the laptop finds itself. I have
successfully integrated [[shortcut debpkg="guessnet"]] in with
[[shortcut debpkg="ifplugd"]], and made sure that things play nice
even with [[shortcut debpkg="hotplug"]] in the picture. So I am a
happy Guessnet camper once again.
